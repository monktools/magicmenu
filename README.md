magicmenu
=========

Hi, and thanks for watching our project. We are the monk(ey)s Newton and Andrea, two digital creative.
While we study users behaviour, we invented this Magic Menu, a double click navigation menu on demand.
The idea is simple:
======  the shortest way to reach your informations is the best one, =====

so why don't create a navigation menu that follow the mouse but is available just on double click 
(that is a few used mouse event)?
And here we are.

Is like a quantistic menu, because there is and there isn't at the same time :). 
Just use the right double click key and wooooo! :)
